# LaserLogger

LaserLogger is a simple tool to log usage of your laser sources and their key parameters such as currents, temperatures, power levels and frequencies.

This tool is particularly designed to work in conjunction with laser systems by Toptica, from which the parameters can be obtained via an ethernet connection. Further data can be obtained from an MQTT broker or entered by hand.

LaserLogger is built using Python and wxWidgets.
